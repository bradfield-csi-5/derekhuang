# Completion Exercise

Write a Bash program that shows summary information from Wikipedia. `wiki walrus` should show the first sentence of the "Walrus" article, along with a list of section headings. `wiki walrus anatomy` should show the first sentence of the anatomy section, along with a list of subsection headings.
* You are welcome to use `curl` to retrieve the page itself, as well as any commands that youâ€™d expect to find on a typical Unix family OS distribution.
* As a stretch goal, add support for tab completion in Bash, ie `wiki walr[tab]` should expand to walrus, and `wiki walrus anat[tab]` should expand to anatomy.
* As another stretch goal, add a flag to support querying multiple pages in parallel.
